Create a small program
Ask the user to enter any value.

Detect its type using type() and print a message like:
"This value is of type string"

If it’s a number, tell whether it’s even, odd, positive, or negative.
Ex: you can check for even like this -> if number % 2 == 0 this will be even otherwise it will be odd
