5. Voting Eligibility Checker

Goal: Determine if a user can vote.
Steps:

Ask the user for their age.

Handle invalid or non-numeric input using try/except.

If age is 0, negative, or non-integer, print appropriate error messages.

If age ≥ 18 → "You are allowed to vote".

Else → "Unfortunately, you are not allowed to vote."
