Ask the user for their email.
Handle empty input using try/except (raise ValueError if empty).
Check if email contains exactly one "@" symbol → if not, print "Invalid email: missing or multiple @ symbols"
Check if there's a "." after the "@" → if not, print "Invalid email: missing domain extension"
If both conditions pass → "Valid email address"
