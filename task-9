Number Checker Function

Goal: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Steps:

Create a function called number_checker(num) and make sure it should be passed a parameter num

Use if-elif-else to check the numberâ€™s sign.

if a number is positive print a message "Positive number" 

if a number is negative print a message "Negative number" (Hint! if number is less than 0 that means it is negative!)

if a number is zero print a message "Zero"

Handle non-integer inputs gracefully with a message like "Input must be integer".(Hint! Use try/except blocks)
