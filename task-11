Login System Using Dictionary

Goal: Manage user login and registration using a dictionary.
Steps:

Create a dictionary: login_details = {"user1": "1234"}.

Ask the user to enter their username.

If it exists, ask for password and verify.

If correct → print "Welcome".

If wrong → print "Access denied".

If username doesn’t exist → ask for new name and password and add to the dictionary.
