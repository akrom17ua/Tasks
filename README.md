Simple ATM Program

Goal: Simulate withdrawing money.
Steps:

Set balance = 1000.

Ask if the user wants to withdraw money (yes/no).

If “yes”: ask for an amount, subtract it, and print the new balance.

If “no”: print "Thanks for using our ATM!".

Handle invalid inputs or negative withdrawal amounts with error messages.
