Create a dictionary:
menu = {"pizza": 8, "pasta": 7, "salad": 5}

Ask the user to:

Add a new item with a price.

Change the price of an existing item.

Delete an item.

Show the full menu.

Use loops to keep the system running until the user types "exit".

Handle wrong inputs or prices with try/except.
