Create a dictionary like library = {"Harry Potter": "available", "1984": "borrowed"}.

Ask the user if they want to “borrow”, “return”, or “add” a book.

If “borrow”: mark the book as "borrowed" if it’s available.

If “return”: mark it as "available".

If “add”: let them add a new title to the dictionary.

Print the updated library each time.

Handle missing or invalid book titles gracefully.
