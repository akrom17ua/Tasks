Ask the user to input 5 student marks.

Store them in a list.

Calculate and print:

The average mark -> You need to add all marks and divide it by 5

The highest and lowest marks -> Use max() and min() functions. Ex: print(max(your_list_name))

How many students passed (mark ≥ 50) # Ex : your_list_name.count(score)
