Grocery Shopping List

Goal: Simulate buying items from a grocery list.
Steps:

Create a list: groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "cheese", "butter"].

Ask the user which product they want to buy.

If it exists, remove it and print "User bought <item>".

If not, print "Not in the list".

Print the updated list.

Use try/except for input validation.
