Ask user for desired username.
Handle empty input using try/except (raise ValueError with "Username cannot be empty").
If length < 5 or length > 15 → "Username must be between 5 and 15 characters"
If username contains spaces → "Username cannot contain spaces"
If username contains only letters and numbers → "Username is available!"
Else → "Username can only contain letters and numbers"
