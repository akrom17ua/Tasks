Create groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"].

Show options: add item, remove item, show all items, clear the list.

After each choice, update and display the list.

If the user tries to remove an item not in the list, show "Item not found!".

Use a while loop so they can keep managing until they type "exit".
