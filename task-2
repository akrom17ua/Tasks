Simple Login/Register System

Goal: Simulate a simple login or registration menu.
Steps:

Create an empty list called passwords = [].

Ask the user whether they want to login or register.

If they type anything else, raise an exception with a clear message.

If “register”: ask for a new password, append it to the list, and confirm registration.

If “login”: ask for a password, check if it exists in the list.

If it exists, print "Welcome to the system!".

If not, print "User not found, please register first."
