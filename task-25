Start with colors = ("red", "green", "blue").

Ask the user if they want to add a new color - > ask "Would you like to add a new color ? yes/no "
If the user enters yes take an input for color and add it to your list
Print the updated lis
Else print "Bye thanks for using my app!"


Important ! Convert the tuple to a list to add the color because tuples cannot be changed !
