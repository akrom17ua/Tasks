create Class Student and it should have two attributes name and grades (grades should be a list).
Add methods:
add_grade(grade)
average() → returns average grade (Hint! to get average sum all list values and divide by its length)
Create an instance of Student and call all methods

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grades):
       #Instantiate attributes name and grades -> ex: self.name = name 

    def add_grade(self, grade):
       #Add this grade to grades list

    def average(self):
        average = sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)
        #Print the average with a good message

#Create an instance of Student class and call all methods available
